# OOPD-Assignment-4
This is for oopd assignment 3 These are the commands that I have used to create the makefile 
1)g++ -c Q1_MT23064.cpp 
Q1_MT23064.cpp is the name of my source file in c++ We are using g++ compiler to compile our source file -c flag means we are generating only the object file , which is the intermediate step in compilation process.
2)g++ -g -o debug1 Q1_MT23064.cpp 
We are using g++compiler to create an executable file named debug1, -g means we are adding debugging information , so that we can run debugger on it and -o specifies the output executable file's name.
3)g++ -O3 -o optimize1 Q1_MT23064.o 
We are using g++compiler to link the Q1_MT23064.o object file and create an executable file named as optimize1, -O3 means high level of optimization in the code is done, and -o flag specifies the output executable file's name.
4)./debug1
We are running the executable file created in previour step and ./ means that executable file is in the current directory.
We are doing same for Q2_MT23064, Q3_MT23064, Q4_MT23064
